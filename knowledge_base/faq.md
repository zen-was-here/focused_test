# Frequently Asked Questions

## Booking Questions

**Q: How far in advance should I book?**
A: For best prices, book flights 2-3 months in advance for domestic travel and 3-6 months for international. Last-minute bookings (within 2 weeks) are typically more expensive.

**Q: Can I book multi-city trips?**
A: Yes, we support multi-city bookings. You can add up to 5 cities in a single itinerary. Additional fees may apply for complex routings.

**Q: What payment methods do you accept?**
A: We accept all major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex), debit cards, PayPal, and bank transfers for bookings over $1000.

## Flight Questions

**Q: What is the difference between direct and non-stop flights?**
A: Direct flights may make stops but you stay on the same plane. Non-stop flights go straight to your destination without any stops.

**Q: Can I select my seat?**
A: Yes, seat selection is available for most airlines. Fees vary by airline and seat type. Some airlines offer free seat selection at check-in.

**Q: What happens if my flight is delayed or cancelled?**
A: If the airline cancels or significantly delays your flight, you're entitled to rebooking or a full refund. We'll assist you with rebooking at no additional charge.

## Hotel Questions

**Q: What is the difference between refundable and non-refundable rates?**
A: Refundable rates can be cancelled for free up to the cancellation deadline. Non-refundable rates are cheaper but cannot be cancelled or changed.
